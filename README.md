##‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
False Positives/Negatives: No model is infallible. Use this alongside other security measures.

Dataset Bias: The accuracy depends on the variety and quality of training data. Uncommon URL patterns or novel phishing techniques might be missed.

Evolving Threats: Cybercriminals continuously adapt their methods. Regular retraining with updated data is recommended for sustained effectiveness.
